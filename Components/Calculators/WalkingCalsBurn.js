// Walking Calories Burned:

// There are two main approaches to estimate calories burned while walking:

// METs (Metabolic Equivalents):
// This method uses METs, a unit representing the energy cost of an activity compared to sitting at rest.

// Estimated Calories Burned = METs x Weight (kg) x Time (hours)

// METs for walking at a moderate pace (3-4 mph): 3.5

// METs for brisk walking (4-5 mph): 5.0

// 2. The Compendium of Physical Activities (CPA):

// This method uses a formula that considers factors like your body weight, walking speed, grade (incline), and time. You can find online calculators or pedometers that use the CPA formula.

// Here are some resources for these calculators:

// METs-based calculator: https://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/10710779/net-calories-burned-from-walking
// CPA-based calculators (may be integrated into pedometer apps): Many fitness trackers and apps offer calorie burn estimates for walking based on the CPA formula.
// Additional Considerations:

// These are estimates, and actual calorie burn can vary depending on factors like terrain, clothing, and individual fitness level.
// Some pedometers or fitness trackers might use more sophisticated algorithms to estimate calorie expenditure.
// Other Exercises:

// The METs approach can be applied to various exercises. Here are some examples:

// Running: METs range from 8.0 (easy running) to 12.0+ (sprinting)
// Cycling: METs range from 4.0 (leisure cycling) to 8.0+ (vigorous cycling)
// Swimming: METs range from 6.0 (moderate swimming) to 8.0+ (vigorous swimming)
// Finding METs Values:

// You can find a comprehensive list of METs values for various activities online from resources like the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) or search for "[Activity Name] METs"

// Remember, consulting a healthcare professional is always recommended for personalized exercise guidance.
