// Distance-Based Exercises (Running, Cycling, Swimming):

// Pace Calculators:

// These calculators can estimate your pace based on a desired distance and time, or vice versa.

// Pace = Distance (km or miles) / Time (hours)
// Calories Burned:

// You can use the METs or CPA methods mentioned earlier, adjusting the METs value based on the exercise intensity (e.g., running vs. jogging).

// Additional Considerations:

// These are just formulas and estimates. Actual results may vary depending on individual factors like fitness level, terrain, and clothing.
// It's always best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance on exercise routines and workout intensity.
// Remember:

// These formulas provide a starting point for your exercise workout calculators. You can expand on them by incorporating features like exercise selection based on muscle groups, workout logs, and progress tracking.
// When creating calculators, ensure they are user-friendly and provide clear instructions for users to input their data accurately.
