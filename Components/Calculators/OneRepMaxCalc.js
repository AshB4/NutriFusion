// One Rep Max (1RM) Calculator:

// There are several estimation formulas for 1RM, 
// but their accuracy can vary. Here's a common one 
// using the weight lifted for a successful repetition (weight)
//  and the number of repetitions (reps):

// Estimated 1RM = weight (kg) x (1 + 0.025 x reps)
// Important Note: 
// These are just formulas, and the results might not be
// perfectly accurate for everyone. It's always best to 
// consult a healthcare professional for personalized guidance
//  on these calculations, especially for BMI and calorie needs.
